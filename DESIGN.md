# Mesher design principles (future milestones)

The current milestone includes a generated manifold, Vulkan viewport,
and a CPU Inflate-brush stroke engine. This document distinguishes implemented
brush behaviour from future geometry-editing capabilities.

## Implemented brush-stroke contract

- Stroke begins with one or more spherical influences (center, radius, hardness).
  Influence is the **maximum** of all spheres at a vertex, not their sum.
  Falloff is 1 inside the hardness fraction of the radius and otherwise
  decreases to 0 via a smooth S-curve (quintic smootherstep).
- All centers move the same distance per stroke update. The stroke samples
  them together at a global fixed arc-length Step, preserving fractional
  progress across updates and corners. It applies the initial stamp and
  guarantees the final endpoint is sampled without duplication.
- Inflate moves vertices along the normalized, equally weighted sum of all
  incident face unit normals, recomputed for each stamp from pre-stamp geometry.
- The demo applies mirror-image half-circles on the front of the sphere.
  Remeshing, density maintenance and interactive painting are **deferred**.

## Non-destructive, minimally invasive topology

- Ordinary brushes first **refine only as necessary**, so the current geometry
  has enough degrees of freedom to represent the requested deformation or
  paint stroke. A brush's editing density is a **minimum**, not a density to
  which an already-fine mesh should be reduced.
- For ordinary deformation, preserve all existing topology wherever possible.
  No automatic decimation merely because a coarse brush passed over detailed
  mesh data.
- Make a standalone brush for explicitly painting local mesh density, with
  refine/simplify/normalize modes. Refinement of planar triangles should not
  move the old surface (no implicit Catmull–Clark smoothing).
- During a stroke, subdivide an overlong edge only when the deformation is
  stretching it farther, and consider collapsing an undersized edge only when
  deformation is compressing it further. Measure actual **local deformation**
  rather than classifying entire brush types as inflate or deflate.
- Collapse candidates must additionally satisfy geometric **and vertex-colour**
  error budgets. A length threshold permits evaluation; it never mandates a
  destructive collapse.
- Preserve manifold connectivity and validity even when artist-controlled
  density policy permits stretching or bunching. Hysteresis must avoid
  split/collapse oscillation.

## Appearance

- Vertex colours are first-class; geometry and colour sample density are tied.
- Importing textured meshes should eventually offer texture-aware local
  tessellation that approximates the texture's appearance to an explicit error
  tolerance without unnecessary global subdivision. Exact finite triangle
  representation of arbitrary bilinear textures is not always possible.
- Never decimate away important scanned geometry or colour details simply to
  reach a requested polygon count.

## Performance and reliability

- CPU topology structures are separate from GPU draw buffers; future updates
  should upload **only changed regions**.
- Editing operations should commit consistent topological transactions;
  failed operations must not leave a half-modified mesh.
- Use a local spatial index for brush hit-testing, deformation, remeshing, and
  validation rather than visiting every vertex in large meshes.
- Explore chunked copy-on-write history and asynchronous crash-recovery
  checkpoints, explicitly trading persistence latency against recovery
  guarantees. Avoid requiring a full-mesh copy per brush stroke.
- Regression tests should cover boundary, degenerate, self-intersection,
  seam, and topology-invariant cases as the feature set grows.

## Open implementation decisions

- Replace the baseline incremental convex hull with a scalable triangulation
  algorithm before importing meshes with millions of vertices.
- Select a mutable half-edge / corner-based topology representation with stable
  vertex IDs and bounded local update costs.
- Define geometric and colour error metrics, surface projection, high-resolution
  persistence, and live brush input/picking policy. Stroke sampling/falloff
  and the first Inflate brush are already implemented.
- Add camera navigation, mesh interaction, editing tools, and import/export.
## Inflate surface-folding regression

The symmetric generator shares equatorial vertices by index. A wide (0.4)
Inflate stroke using face normals re-evaluated after each stamp nonetheless
made several positive-hemisphere vertices cross the symmetry plane and
inverted nearby faces. This is a geometric fold, not duplicate seam geometry.

The default Inflate mode now evaluates the normalized, equal-weight incident
face normal **once at stroke start**, keeping each vertex's direction stable
through all repeated stamps. This also eliminates repeated normal computations
and avoids the tested fold without modifying topology. Optional
`NormalSampling::PerStamp` retains the old dynamic-normal mode for testing;
it is not safe against large-deformation foldovers. Radius 0.4 is now the
configurable demo default (via `--brush-radius`). A 5,000-vertex regression
tests the shared ring, non-crossing hemispheres, reflection symmetry, and
outward manifold topology after the full stroke.

This does not establish a general guarantee against self-intersections or
face inversions for arbitrary imported meshes and large strokes. A robust
geometry-validity guard and adaptive remeshing are separate future tasks.

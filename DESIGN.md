# Mesher design principles (future milestones)

The current milestone includes a generated manifold, Vulkan viewport,
and a CPU Inflate-brush stroke engine. This document distinguishes implemented
brush behaviour from future geometry-editing capabilities.

## Implemented brush-stroke contract

- Stroke begins with one or more spherical influences (center, radius, hardness).
  Influence is the **maximum** of all spheres at a vertex, not their sum.
  Falloff is 1 inside the hardness fraction of the radius and otherwise
  decreases to 0 via a smooth S-curve (quintic smootherstep).
- All centers move the same distance per stroke update. The stroke samples
  them together at a global fixed arc-length Step, preserving fractional
  progress across updates and corners. It applies the initial stamp and
  guarantees the final endpoint is sampled without duplication.
- Inflate moves vertices along the normalized, equally weighted sum of all
  incident face unit normals, recomputed for each stamp from pre-stamp geometry.
- The demo applies mirror-image half-circles on the front of the sphere.
  Remeshing, density maintenance and interactive painting are **deferred**.

## Non-destructive, minimally invasive topology

- Ordinary brushes first **refine only as necessary**, so the current geometry
  has enough degrees of freedom to represent the requested deformation or
  paint stroke. A brush's editing density is a **minimum**, not a density to
  which an already-fine mesh should be reduced.
- For ordinary deformation, preserve all existing topology wherever possible.
  No automatic decimation merely because a coarse brush passed over detailed
  mesh data.
- Make a standalone brush for explicitly painting local mesh density, with
  refine/simplify/normalize modes. Refinement of planar triangles should not
  move the old surface (no implicit Catmull–Clark smoothing).
- During a stroke, subdivide an overlong edge only when the deformation is
  stretching it farther, and consider collapsing an undersized edge only when
  deformation is compressing it further. Measure actual **local deformation**
  rather than classifying entire brush types as inflate or deflate.
- Collapse candidates must additionally satisfy geometric **and vertex-colour**
  error budgets. A length threshold permits evaluation; it never mandates a
  destructive collapse.
- Preserve manifold connectivity and validity even when artist-controlled
  density policy permits stretching or bunching. Hysteresis must avoid
  split/collapse oscillation.

## Appearance

- Vertex colours are first-class; geometry and colour sample density are tied.
- Importing textured meshes should eventually offer texture-aware local
  tessellation that approximates the texture's appearance to an explicit error
  tolerance without unnecessary global subdivision. Exact finite triangle
  representation of arbitrary bilinear textures is not always possible.
- Never decimate away important scanned geometry or colour details simply to
  reach a requested polygon count.

## Performance and reliability

- CPU topology structures are separate from GPU draw buffers; future updates
  should upload **only changed regions**.
- Editing operations should commit consistent topological transactions;
  failed operations must not leave a half-modified mesh.
- Use a local spatial index for brush hit-testing, deformation, remeshing, and
  validation rather than visiting every vertex in large meshes.
- Explore chunked copy-on-write history and asynchronous crash-recovery
  checkpoints, explicitly trading persistence latency against recovery
  guarantees. Avoid requiring a full-mesh copy per brush stroke.
- Regression tests should cover boundary, degenerate, self-intersection,
  seam, and topology-invariant cases as the feature set grows.

## Open implementation decisions

- Replace the baseline incremental convex hull with a scalable triangulation
  algorithm before importing meshes with millions of vertices.
- Select a mutable half-edge / corner-based topology representation with stable
  vertex IDs and bounded local update costs.
- Define geometric and colour error metrics, surface projection, high-resolution
  persistence, and live brush input/picking policy. Stroke sampling/falloff
  and the first Inflate brush are already implemented.
- Add camera navigation, mesh interaction, editing tools, and import/export.
## Live Inflate deformation and diagnostic playback

The symmetric generator shares equatorial vertex **indices**; the observed
crossing wires are not caused by separate hemisphere vertex rings. Repeated
normal-based deformation can rotate incident triangle normals until triangles
fold through the symmetry plane, despite the original normals pointing outward.

We reverted the temporary stroke-start frozen-normal workaround so the Inflate
brush once again uses the current geometry's face normals **every stamp**.
The symmetric half-circle demo is now processed one stamp per viewport update
at 10 stamps/second (configurable). `InflateDemoAnimation` records a sequence
using normal `BrushStroke` sampling, then applies each stamp incrementally.
It supports reset and exact replay. The rendering layer owns the animation
clock and updates the same Vulkan buffers only after waiting for the prior GPU
frame to finish. This is full-buffer replacement for now, not dirty regions.

The viewport reports the number of *radially inverted* triangles to help
locate the start of a fold. This is only a diagnostic for the unit sphere,
not a complete test for self-intersection. Geometry fold prevention and
remeshing remain intentionally deferred.
